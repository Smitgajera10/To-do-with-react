# To-Do App with React

This is a simple and responsive **To-Do App** built with **React**, utilizing **Context API** for state management and **Local Storage** for data persistence. The app allows users to manage their tasks efficiently with features like adding, editing, completing, and deleting tasks.

- **Edit Todos**: Modify existing tasks (disabled for completed tasks).
- **Mark as Complete**: Toggle tasks as completed or incomplete.
